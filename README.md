Final Project Machine Learning Fundamentals.

Project Description:

Classification problem to detect COVID-19 through chest X-ray images. COVID-19 has significantly impacted global health, and early, accurate detection is crucial, especially for identifying pneumonia caused by the virus.

The project aims to classify chest X-rays into three categories:

- COVID-19: Pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
- Normal: No pneumonia present.
- Pneumonia: Pneumonia not caused by COVID-19.


Using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques, we will improve detection accuracy and efficiency. The methods include Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Random Forest classification, and deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) employing various architectures.
